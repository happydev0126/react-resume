# ReactJS Resume Website Template
![ReactJS Resume Website Template](resume-screenshot.jpg?raw=true "ReactJS Resume Website Template")
## Description
This is a ReactJS based personal resume website template. I have built this beginning with the Ceevee template by Styleshout (credits below), and breaking up their template into isolated React components. Data is fed directly from a JSON File. This means that in its final form, it can be customized and used by anybody simply by filling in their own personal info into the JSON file and the changes will be dynamically fed into the site. If you would like to use this template for your own personal resume website, read on to learn how to build your own copy.
